        "        - This includes defining our independent (features) and dependent (targets) variables\n",

        "    2. **Experimental Studies**\n",
        "\n",
        "- In an **observational study**, we are simply observing our independent and dependent variables. We don't have control over how observational units get assigned to specific values of either the independent or dependent variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Observational Study Example\n",
        "\n",
        "- For example, suppose I wanted to know if the mean annual income differs between undergraduate data science majors and psychology majors.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In this case, mean annual income serves as my quantitative dependent (or outcome) variable and major (data science or psychology) serves as my categorical independent (or predictor/explanatory) variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "- I as the researcher in this case don't have control over whether students are data science or psychology majors -- I'm simply observing a phenomenon.\n",
        "    - So this study would be classified as an *observational* study.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Let's contrast this with an experimental study.\n",

        "#### Experimental Study Example\n",

        "- Let's say you work for a marketing department in a retail company. We have an email list of 10,000 customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- We want to test the impact of two different email subject lines (e.g., a generic subject line and a personalized subject line) on annual spending with our company.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In this case, we could randomly assign our customers to either the generic subject line group or the personalized subject line group and follow their spending over the course of a year before making a comparison.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Email group serves as our categorical independent variable and annual spending serves as our quantitative outcome variable.\n",
        "\n",

        "- Over the course of the semester, you will see how DOE is important to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Informed Decision-Making**: It provides a structured approach to testing hypotheses, allowing people/organizations to make data-driven decisions based on reliable evidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Resource Optimization**: By identifying what works and what doesn't, people/organizations can allocate their resources more efficiently, avoiding wasted time and money on ineffective strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Process Improvement**: Well-designed experiments can uncover insights that lead to innovative solutions and improvements, which may serve as a competitive advantage in a business setting.\n",

        "- **Experiment (or Run)**: an action where the experimenter changes at least one of the variables being studied and then observes the effect of the action.\n",
        "    - Randomizing our customers into the generic and personalized email groups and then observing their purchasing behavior was an experiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Experimental Unit**: the item under study upon which something is changed. This could be raw materials, human subjects, or just a point in time.\n",
        "    - Our individual customers in the marketing example were our experimental units.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Independent Variable (Factor or Treatment Factor or Feature)**: We generally think of this as the $X$ variable that is being controlled at some level during any given experiment.\n",
        "    - Email group from the prior example\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Lurking Variable (Background Variable)**: a variable that the experimenter is unaware of or cannot control which could have an effect on the outcome of the experiment.\n",
        "    - In the email example, annual income probably plays a role in annual spending. This isn't something the marketing department can control.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dependent Variable (or Response or Outcome or Target)**: Usually denoted $Y$, this is the characteristic of the experimental unit that is measured after each experiment/run.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Effect**: The change in the response that is caused by a change in a factor/independent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "- These definitions will get us started, but there will be more new terms added as we progress through the semester!\n",

        "### Planning Experiments\n",
        "\n",
        "- The key to successful experiments (and studies in general really) is a very clear articulation about what you're studying, why you're studying it, how you're studying it, and how you'll draw conclusions from the experiment(s).\n",
        "\n",
        "- More specifically:\n",
        "    - **(1)** Define the objective\n",
        "    - **(2)** Decide what the outcome is (and how it will be measured)\n",
        "    - **(3)** Determine the independent variables and possible lurking variables\n",
        "    - **(4)** Choose the design (more on this as the semester progresses)\n",
        "    - **(5)** Be clear on data collection processes/procedures\n",
        "    - **(6)** Be clear on which analyses will be performed and how they are appropriate for the objective and design\n",
        "    - **(7)** Draw conclusions\n",
